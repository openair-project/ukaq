# Metadata

The first step when importing air quality data is to consult `import_ukaq_meta()`. Let's have a look at the AURN metadata now:

```{r}
import_ukaq_meta("aurn")
```

This output can be customised using different function arguments. For example, lets find sites which measured O~3~ in 2020.

```{r}
meta <- import_ukaq_meta("aurn", year = 2020, by_pollutant = TRUE)
meta[meta$pollutant == "O3",]
```

To import data, please make a note of the relevant site codes in the "code" column (and, if appropriate, the "source" network of the data.

# Continuous Monitoring
